          <h1>30 Minutes Film Festival</h1>
          <h3>In this project, students were given 30 minutes to create a film.
          Everything- from brainstorming the ideas to filming and editing- was done
          in just 30 minutes.</h3>

          <h3>This term's 30 Minutes Film Festival (30MFF) theme was "CONNECTION" and
          "INTERACTION." When we thought about connection, we naturally agreed that
          connection, interaction, and communication these days, especially in the midst
          of Covid-19, is done through our electronic or mobile devices and internet.</h3>

          <h3>With this idea, we thought about how when we connect our chargers to the socket
          and turn our phones on, we are able to connect with anyone, wherever they are. We
          emphasized this point by reversing the video once, implying that as chargers come off
          and phones are turned off, connection is lost or becomes harder.</h3>

          <h4>The film was taken with classmates Yasmin Alshorafa and
          Tina Zhang. The website was done as an individual project. </h4>

          <h1>The Missing Cat</h1>
          <h3>The second project was about creating  a comic and base it and display it
          on the web. Our team thought hard about how to create an original content.
          As we were not originally comic creators, it was hard to come up with such topic. So,
          we decided to have our target audience as the New York University Abu Dhabi student
          body and create a content that all NYUAD students would be able to relate to.</h3>

          <h3>That's when we came up with our campus cats! Our thought started from the imgination
          what if a cat got lost on our campus? As NYUAD students and campus cat lover ousrelves, we
          knew that this would be a big issue on campus and that everybody would join us on the solving the
          mystery.</h3>

          <h3>So, that's where our story starts- the missing cat. Will you join us on the journey?</h3>

          <h1>CL Travel Agency</h1>
          <h3>Hello! Welcome to CL Travel Agency!</h3>

          <h3>We are sure that you are dying to get on a plane and travel soemwhere. Anywhere!</h3>

          <h3>Covid-19 maken it hard to travel around different countries for all of us around the world.
          Don't worry! Our travel agency will give you a call to check your preferences. To make it easier
          for you to picture your travel destination. Close your eyes, make your choices.. and voila!
          It'll feel like you're there!</h3>

          <h3>This project started from the thought that we want to have interactivyt and through that
          interactivity, it'd be nice if the sound could build up the more user interacts. We thought
          about portraying a landscape, but with sound. We agreed that the best concept to put out this
          functionality was to have a travel agency and allow the user to actually hear the sound of
          their travel destination.</h3>

          <h1>How to Spend Time Safely at Home - Origami</h1>
          <h3>This project started from our conversation that 'everyday gets so boring during the pandemic.'
            We were all tired of staying home. Even the games we used to like seemed more boring that just
            having a walk outside. </h3>

            <h3>We wondered, 'how hard would it be to be a mother of a kid during this pandemic?' We
            thought that Covid-19 would be hard for kids and their parents as much as, if not more, it is for us.</h3>

            <h3>With this thought, we decided that in this project, we want to introduce people to a new activity
            they can do safely at home. We wanted to have the target as everyone, from kids and parents to adults. We
            thought about an activity in which introductory level is easy for everybody to follow.</h3>

            <h3>Then, we came up with ORIGAMI</h3>

            <h3>Origami is a good activity for nearly everyone as there are works suitable for each level. Also,
            as for adults, it is a nostalgic activity they did as a kid. We believe this activity will warm
            your hear in these cold times.</h3>

            <h3>So, are you bored? Follow along our origami tutorial videos and get yourself a new hobby!</h3>

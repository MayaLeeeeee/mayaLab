      <h1>About Me!</h1>
      <h3>Hi! I'm Maya and I'm a undergraduate student studying in New York University Abu Dhabi.
      I'm from South Korea and I'm majoring in computer science and double minoring in interactive
       media and Arabic.</h3>

      <h3>The works I am currently doing or website development and front-end development. But, as a
      undergraduate student, I am not totally sure about which field of computer science I should
      or want to pursue. As of now, I am planning to have a taste of Artificial Intelligence
      and Robot Intelligence.</h3>

      <h3>As a devleoper, I wish to explore more fields out in the world and figure out how to deliver
      my thoughts and messages. Also, I aspire to become somebody who would be able to solve social
      problems I note and be able to contribute in solving it through develpment.</h3>

      <h3>If you are interested in how I will progress, please keep an eye on me!</h3>

      <h1>About Communications Lab!</h1>
      <h3>This course is an introductory level course that is open to students interested in interactive
      media, regardless of their prior experience or knowledge! It's main goal is to introduce students
      to the most basic programs and platforms that can be used in making a website and helping them
      understand the fundamental elements of interactive media.</h3>

      <h3>With assignments, students were able to look into different elements of media such as sound and
      video. We learned how to record good sound by using adequate recorders etc. and editing the audio files
      so that it best meets the audience's expectation. We also learned how to use cameras and edit the videos
      for them to best suite the websites we are creating.</h3>

      <h3>After the whole curriculum of this course, I think I learned most of the basic parts of what makes a product
      an interactive media. It may not be the most professional, but we know how to implement things that we can draw in
      our heads. This will be the start of our journey to mastering interactive media.</h3>

      <h1>About Me!</h1>
      <h3>Hi! I'm Maya and I'm a undergraduate student studying in New York University Abu Dhabi.
      I'm from South Korea and I'm majoring in computer science and double minoring in interactive
       media and Arabic.</h3>

      <h3>The works I am currently doing or website development and front-end development. But, as a
      undergraduate student, I am not totally sure about which field of computer science I should
      or want to pursue. As of now, I am planning to have a taste of Artificial Intelligence
      and Robot Intelligence.</h3>

      <h3>As a devleoper, I wish to explore more fields out in the world and figure out how to deliver
      my thoughts and messages. Also, I aspire to become somebody who would be able to solve social
      problems I note and be able to contribute in solving it through develpment.

      If you are interested in how I will progress, please keep an eye on me!</h3>
